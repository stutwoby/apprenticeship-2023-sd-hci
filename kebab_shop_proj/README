this took some time off of my life. its so basic. and yet so annoying to make. javascript makes no sense.

anyways, set up full user interface on localhost, i was thinking of setting up sql db, but didnt think there was much point since i dont want an account system really because nobody wants to be making loads of different accounts for everything, however i could add a encryption system for storing payment details, and add support for things like paypal or klarna incase someone wants to 12 month finance their kebabs. i decided to use tailwind which has been interesting. however i didnt really focus on the appearance of the webpage. also, with the delievery times, i am literally just randomising the estiamted time between 30-60 minutes. i should really use an api or something like that to check traffic conditions between 2 locations and find the quickest route. maybe later on.
