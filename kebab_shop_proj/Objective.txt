Dear Sir/Madam,​

​

I hope you are well!​


We have recently opened one of our takeaway shops on Mapperlay Lane and we are in dire need for a new software system! Normally when a customer phones us up we
take the order manually, write down their details and address, get their order on the paper with their selection of sides, sauces, drinks and then we sent it
out for delivery once it is ready.​
At the moment, we are looking for a more digital or automated approach when taking customers details and their desired orders. We specialise in various sauces
so the customers need to have the ability to order one dish and choose multiple sauces if they like to. At the end we would like the system to print out a
receipt with the order that is broken down with individual pricing and have the total in the end, including the delivery services. Is this something you are
capable of doing so?​
Many thanks​
