I used MySQL workbench, but im sure you can use anything. just make the connection, if you want to use my code, you can just put it on 127.0.0.1:3306.
obviously, youll need to make an account with elevated perms, and then put the details for it on here: db, err = sql.Open("mysql", "devuser:123456@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/kebabshop").

should also be noted, the database im using is called kebabshop, so change that if needed. 
then, im just using the login table, which you can create the same way i have with this query:

CREATE TABLE kebabshop.login (
    ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
